# Blue Hour Odyssey

*Blue Hour Odyssey* is a narrative adventure game that takes place in a unique setting.

In *Blue Hour Odyssey*, you guide three travelers through a world without sunlight. On the way you come across different inhabitants of the world and how you interact with them will affect your travelers’ morale. Each traveler has their own personality and their own opinions about how you ought to resolve the situations you encounter — and should just one traveler lose all hope and head home, the whole journey is a lost cause!

This short cycle game was developed in the latter half of 2024 by a team of four developers.
